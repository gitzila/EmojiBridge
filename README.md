# EmojiBridge
A quick and dirty Android App to bring emojis to HK8 pro max (and maybe other smartwatches).

It fakes itself as "com.tencent.mm"-package (this is the package of the WeeChat app), so you can activate it in WearFit pro App to get notifications from.

After installing put both properties-files in this folder:

/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.tencent.mm/files

Create folder if does not exist.

Grant "read notifications"-permission to this app.
